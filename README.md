This project was made for the Calculator exercise on the Odin Project Fundamentals Course.

The assignment required to create:
- A functional and simple calculator that enables a user to run calculations between two numbers at a time;

- It features adding, subtractions, multiplications and divisions;
    - Given that it is not possible to divide a number by zero, an alert will be thrown saying that, not affecting the previous inputs.

- The user can use both the mouse and the keyboard to insert numbers, operators and actions;
    - When it comes to operators, there's "+" for adding, "-" for subtractions, "*" for divisions and "/" for divisions;
    - When it comes to actions, there's "ENTER key" for the result of the calculation, "BACKSPACE key" to delete both the value in the numberInput variable, and the values in the arrayInput variable, "e key" to delete the current number in the numberInput variable.

Other features will be added to this program, but all the assisgnment tasks and extra credit tasks where (in my understanding) added to this project.
